# Sharks-Attacks
This Python project conducts an in-depth analysis of shark attacks using the comprehensive "Sharks Attack" dataset. The aim is to explore and evaluate the frequency and patterns of shark attacks on individuals across different states.

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:

Analyze: Investigate the occurrences of shark attacks.
Visualize: Present insights through visual representations and graphs.
Evaluate: Identify trends and patterns in shark attacks across various states.
Key Features
Data Cleaning: Thoroughly clean and preprocess the raw dataset for analysis.
Statistical Analysis: Utilize statistical methods to derive meaningful conclusions.
Visualization: Generate visual representations using matplotlib or seaborn.
Geographical Mapping: Plot geospatial data to illustrate attack hotspots.
Insightful Findings: Interpret findings to understand factors influencing attack frequencies.
Tools Used
Python: Utilized as the primary programming language for data analysis.
Pandas & NumPy: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Employed for data visualization.
Jupyter Notebooks: Possibly utilized for step-by-step analysis.
How to Use
Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/username/project.git
Install Dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Analysis: Follow instructions in the README or Jupyter Notebook.
Contributions
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or provide suggestions for improvement.

Dataset Information
The dataset used for this project is sourced from kaggle. It contains detailed information about shark attacks, including location, time, severity, and other relevant attributes.
